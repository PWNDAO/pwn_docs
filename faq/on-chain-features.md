# On-chain features

### Which chains/ETH L2s is PWN planning to expand to?

We plan to expand to other chains as determined by users and community input. If you would like us to consider a specific chain, please contact us at support@pwn.xyz.&#x20;

### Is there any risk? (Are the contracts audited? Is PWN safe?)&#x20;

PWN Protocol V1 has been audited by Extropy and Nethermind and the audits are [publically available](https://linktr.ee/pwn.audits).&#x20;

Although we are confident in what we've built and take security very seriously at PWN, as with any project in web3 or crypto, there is always some risk of smart contract exploits, up to and including loss of your funds or NFTs.

Additionally, investing always assumes risk due to market fluctuations. PWN does not determine the value of your digital assets and cannot guarantee a borrower's repayment.&#x20;

### How does PWN handle rebasing tokens?

PWN does not currently accommodate rebasing tokens in any custom way, so using them as collateral is not recommended. However, some rebasing tokens have wrapper contracts which can keep the token amount constant.&#x20;

### Can my NFT receive airdrops during the loan duration? Can I use the NFT for governance purposes (voting) during the loan duration?

Yes, you can! We've built a solution called PWN Safe that allows you to tokenize the transfer rights of an asset and use the so-called Asset Transfer Rights (ATR) token as collateral. Look at the following PWN Safe explainer video we've created to understand how it works.
