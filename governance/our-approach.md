# Our approach

We are committed to providing the best user experience possible, and we don't believe in deciding everything behind closed doors. That is why **we have a** [**forum**](https://forum.pwn.finance/) where users can discuss anything PWN related. PWN team members are active on the forum so that you can talk to us about your needs. **We also have a** [**snapshot**](https://snapshot.org/#/pwnfinance.eth), where our users can vote.

{% hint style="info" %}
PWN protocol is currently in the beta stage, and we do not have a complete decentralized governance solution or governance token.
