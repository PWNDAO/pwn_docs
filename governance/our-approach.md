# Our approach

We are committed to providing the best user experience possible, and we don't believe in deciding everything behind closed doors. That is why **we have a forum** where users can discuss anything PWN related. PWN team members are active on the forum so that you can talk to us about your needs. **We also have a snapshot.** If you have a proposal, you can submit it there, and the community will decide.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
PWN protocol is currently in the beta stage, and we do not have a complete decentralized governance solution or governance token.
