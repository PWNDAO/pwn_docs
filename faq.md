# FAQ

### **Do you charge any fees?**&#x20;

We plan to charge a fee for each loan created on PWN, as well as a fee for secondary deed sales. The current model is free of fees to support faster product adoption.

### **Which chains/ETH L2s is PWN planning to expand to?**&#x20;

PWN Protocol is deployed only on the Ethereum mainnet. Our designs allow us to easily deploy the protocol essentially anywhere. We will follow the demand.

### **What’s PWN’s problem with lending pools?**&#x20;

A lending pool is the best invention since sliced bread - the DeFi ecosystem would quite literally not exist without it. However, since it’s optimised for liquidity you have to make trade-offs which lead to a reduced number of assets that are natively compatible with your protocol.
