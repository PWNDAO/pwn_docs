# FAQ

### **What is PWN’s market niche?**&#x20;

While we are actively monitoring the industry for low-hanging fruit, it must be acknowledged that we’re operating in a massive blue ocean from the perspective of $ market size as well as the technology evolution potential, which favours projects with a broad reach that are able to run many consecutive experiments and iterate on them - hence why we chose the open approach.

### **How does PWN bootstrap liquidity?**

What’s the market size and how was it calculated? The current total available market is $6 billion with the prospect of growing to around $100 billion dollars by 2025. We added up valuations of leading NFT collections along with valuations of exotic ERC-20s and filtered out assets that can already be easily deployed in DeFi to get a more accurate result. (Even though all assets that are used in pools can be also deployed in PWN today)

### **Do you charge any fees?**&#x20;

We plan on charging a fee for each loan created on PWN, as well as a fee for secondary deed sales. The current model is free of fees to support faster product adoption.

### **Which chains/ETH L2s is PWN planning to expand to?**&#x20;

Our designs allow us to easily deploy the protocol essentially anywhere. We will follow the demand.

### **What’s PWN’s problem with lending pools?**&#x20;

A lending pool is the best invention since sliced bread - the DeFi ecosystem would quite literally not exist without it.

However since it’s optimised for liquidity you have to make trade-offs which lead to reduced number of assets that are natively compatible with your protocol.
