# Permissionless design

Permissionless can seem like a buzzword, but for us, it's a core concept that we stand behind. So what does it mean in the context of PWN protocol?

### Use any asset as a collateral

Permissionless design is built in the core nature of our protocol. There are no limitations of what token you want to use as collateral. **Currently, we support ERC-721, ERC-1155 and ERC-20 tokens.**&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
### With great power comes great responsibility

We won't tell you what interest should you agree on or who should you borrow your funds to. We are doing everything in our power to protect our users from scams, but please, **be sure to check you're interacting with genuine assets when you use our protocol.**
{% endhint %}
