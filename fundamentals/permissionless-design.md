# Permissionless design

Permissionless can seem like a buzzword, but for us, it's a core concept that we stand behind. So what does it mean in the context of the PWN protocol?

### Use any asset as collateral

Permissionless design is built into the core nature of our protocol. That means you can use any standard token as collateral. **Currently, we support ERC-721, ERC-1155 and ERC-20 standards.**

#### With great power comes great responsibility

PWN provides a secure protocol; what our users borrow or lend is up to them. Be sure to double-check that you're interacting with a genuine asset before you submit any transaction.
