# LOAN token

### What is a LOAN token?

LOAN is an NFT representing a loan in the PWN protocol. With a LOAN token, you have the right to claim the tokens when the borrower repays the loan or to claim the underlying collateral if the lender defaults.

### How do I get a LOAN token?

A LOAN token is created when a borrower decides to accept an offer from a lender. The borrower creates the LOAN token by executing a transaction on the network. Also, you can obtain a LOAN token by buying it on a secondary market such as [opensea](https://opensea.io/collection/pwn-deed).

### Secondary markets

Since LOAN tokens are standard NFTs they allow for great composability. You can buy LOAN tokens on [opensea](https://opensea.io/collection/pwn-deed). You can even back a loan in PWN protocol with a LOAN token to further leverage your assets!
