# Peer-to-Peer lending

A Fundamental concept that enables the PWN Protocol to function is peer-to-peer (P2P) lending.

### P2P lending vs Lending pools

Most lending platforms currently use the pool model. The pool model enables quick and secure lending solutions. But this solution has its disadvantages. It is only possible to lend or borrow assets that are approved by the platform. A new asset introduces risk not just to one lender but to all lenders.

In the lending pool model, lenders add their assets into a pool. Then, anyone can deposit approved collateral (usually approved by a DAO). Borrowers can then borrow against their deposited collateral.

With P2P lending, we gain the ability to lend or borrow any asset. It's up to the lender and borrower to decide the loan terms. If a lender chooses to accept a risky asset as collateral, it doesn't affect other lenders.

### Gotchas of P2P lending

The fact that it's possible to borrow against any asset doesn't mean it will happen. There must be both borrowers and lenders. If either side is not satisfied with the proposed terms of a loan, the loan won't be realized.

Another critical consideration is that a specific borrower must be connected to a specific lender. This makes fulfilling loans a process that can take minutes or hours, even with a large user base.
