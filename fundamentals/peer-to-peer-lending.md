# Peer-to-Peer lending

A Fundamental concept that enables PWN to function is peer-to-peer (P2P) lending.

### P2P lending vs Lending pools

Most used lending platforms currently use the pool model. The pool model enables quick and secure lending solutions. But this solution has its disadvantages. It is possible to lend or borrow only assets that are approved. A new asset introduces risk not just to one lender but to all lenders.

In the lending pool model, lenders pool their assets into a pool. Then, borrowers supply approved collateral (usually approved by a DAO). Borrowers can then borrow against their collateral.

With P2P lending, we gain the ability to lend or borrow any asset. It's up to the lender and borrower to decide the loan terms. If a lender chooses to accept risky asset as collateral, it doesn't affect other lenders.

### Gotchas of P2P lending

The fact that it's possible to borrow against any asset doesn't mean it will happen. There have to be both borrowers and lenders. If either side is not satisfied with the proposed terms of a loan, the loan won't be realized.

Another critical consideration is that a specific borrower must be connected to a specific lender. This makes creating loans a process that can take minutes or hours, even with a large user base.
