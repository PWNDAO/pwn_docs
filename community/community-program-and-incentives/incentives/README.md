# Protocol Incentives

The platform will distribute reputation rewards, rewarding active usage and contributions to the PWN ecosystem.

Similar to other lending platforms, both lenders and borrowers will receive rewards for their activity on our platform and protocol.

## Incentives for Borrowers

Borrowers will earn incentives based on the value of the loan and interest repaid. Incentives are earned when the borrower repays a loan.

Simply posting a borrowing proposal does _not_ qualify borrowers for incentives.

In case of default (failure to repay the loan and interest), the collateral will be transferred to the lender and the borrower doesn't earn any rewards. Be sure to repay your loans on time to retain your rewards.

## Incentives for Lenders

Lenders will receive incentives based on the amount of capital lent (credit). These incentives are earned once a borrower repays or defaults from the loan.

Just posting a lending proposal does _not_ qualify lenders for incentives. If a borrower defaults, the lender will receive the collateral and keep the earned rewards.

_Additionally, third-party incentives (points or tokens) will be distributed by selected projects integrated with PWN. Please note that PWN does not control or hold custody over these rewards, and they will be claimable according to the partner project's claiming processes._
