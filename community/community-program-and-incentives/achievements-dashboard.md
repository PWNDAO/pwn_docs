Your reputation score reflects the total reputation points (reps) you have accumulated on the connected wallet. Besides completing achievement![](broken-reference)s by using our protocol, you can also earn reps by creating social content on X.

The formula for earning reps through the protocol is: **1 Rep = $100 of volume**.

***

### Reputation from lending

You earn rep by lending, with **1 rep** awarded for **every $100** worth of tokens lent at the time the loan is created.
