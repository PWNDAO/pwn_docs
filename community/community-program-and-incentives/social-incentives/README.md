# Social incentives

```
DISCLAIMER: Social incentives are currently live only for our Ambassadors.
```

***

Good social content builds momentum, that's why we want to build a system of rewarding community members and ambassadors for spreading the word about PWN and give the community a chance to earn reps in more ways than just generating volume on the platform.

Community members are free to create any PWN content they want, with rewards being based on the content type and engagement it generates.

Below you can see different kinds of content that you can create.

| Content type     |
| ---------------- |
| Memes            |
| Education posts  |
| Threads          |
| Twitter articles |
| Bounty posts     |
