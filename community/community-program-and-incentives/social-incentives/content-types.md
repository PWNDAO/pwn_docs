## Thread and X articles

Similar to educational content, threads and articles are longer-form pieces that provide in-depth insights. We're looking for content that explains platform features, explores DeFi strategies leveraging opportunities on the protocol, or offers deep dives into areas like DAO functionality and more.

**Example:** A main account thread introducing the **PWN DAO**.

## Bounty posts

Bounty posts, or **bounties**, are special tasks designed for the **Community and Ambassadors**. These tasks are **time-limited** and require content creators to focus on a specific area.

Bounties are one-off tasks with clear visions, goals, and rewards that help shape the narrative and disseminate important updates within the community.
