# Community Program and Incentives

We are presenting a community and incentives program for all PWN users to incentivize usage of our platform and protocol. Below is a summary of how incentives will be accounted for on the platform.

***

The **Incentives Program** is designed to **build community** and spread the word about **PWN**. It consists of two main ways to earn **reputation points (reps):**

1️⃣ **Protocol Incentives** – Earn reps by interacting with the platform.\
2️⃣ **Social Incentives** – Earn reps by creating content and engaging with the community.
