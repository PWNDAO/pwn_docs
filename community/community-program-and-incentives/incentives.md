# Protocol Incentives

The platform will distribute reputation rewards, rewarding active usage and contributions to the PWN ecosystem.

Similar to other lending platforms, both lenders and borrowers will receive rewards for their activity on our platform and protocol.

| Incentives for Borrowers                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Incentives for Lenders                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

#### Example Scenario

* Mark wants to use $100,000 worth of $ABC as collateral to borrow 50,000 USDC with fixed interest of 10 %.
* James agrees to lend 50,000 USDC to Mark and accepts his proposal.
* Rewards will accrue as follows:
  * Mark will be incentivized based on the 50,000 USDC of credit and 5,000 USDC of interest. He'll earn 55 rep when he repays the loan.
  * James will be incentivized based on the 50,000 USDC he lent and earn 50 rep when he funds the loan.

If Mark fails to repay the loan, James will keep his earned rewards and get to claim the $ABC collateral.

_Additionally, third-party incentives (points or tokens) will be distributed by selected projects integrated with PWN. Please note that PWN does not control or hold custody over these rewards, and they will be claimable according to the partner project's claiming processes._
