# Welcome to PWN

[**PWN**](https://pwn.xyz/) **is a peer-to-peer permissionless lending protocol**.&#x20;

In the true spirit of DeFi composability, PWN users can borrow against—or lend using—any asset in their wallet (ERC-20, NFT, and even a bundle of both), while enjoying absolute flexibility on the loan terms (LTV, duration, APR, etc.).&#x20;

The oracle-less nature of the protocol protects all PWN loans from price-based liquidations. The only way to lose collateral is to default on a loan.

PWN opens up **new liquidity avenues, composability options, and leverage opportunities**, while giving its users both optimized **capital efficiency** and **predictability** on both sides of the loan. A win on all fronts.

The PWN Protocol is currently deployed on **Ethereum, Polygon, Optimism, Arbitrum, Base, Binance Smart Chain, and Cronos.**
