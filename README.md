# What is PWN?

PWN is a decentralized and permissionless DeFi application. **Unlock the full potential of your assets** such as in-game collectibles, art or ERC-20 tokens - all of that without the risk of liquidation.

### **What problem does PWN solve?**

Traditional DeFi lending platforms like Aave enable you to leverage only a few selected tokens. With PWN, you can use all kinds of assets. **You can borrow against assets that are not supported by pool-based lending platforms.** For example, NFTs like collectibles from Play-to-earn games or any ERC-20 tokens are supported as collateral.
