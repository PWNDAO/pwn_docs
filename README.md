# What is PWN?

PWN is a decentralized and permissionless DeFi protocol. **Unlock the full potential of your assets** such as in-game collectibles, art or ERC-20 tokens - all of that without the risk of liquidation.

### **What problem does PWN solve?**

Traditional lending platforms like Aave enable you to leverage only a few selected tokens. With PWN, you can use all kinds of assets. **You can borrow against assets that are not supported by pool-based lending platforms.** For example, NFTs like collectibles from Play-to-earn games or any ERC-20 tokens are supported as collateral.

### How do I get started with PWN?

The most convenient way to use the PWN protocol is via our custom [web application](https://app.pwn.finance).

Currently, the PWN protocol is in the Alpha stage. That means only people with early access POAPs can use the app. To get the POAP, please register on our [waitlist](https://pwn.finance/waitlist).

{% hint style="info" %}
Register on the waitlist even if you have the POAP. Probably nothing.
