# What is PWN?

PWN is a peer-to-peer lending protocol on Ethereum and Polygon that allows users to **borrow and lend digital assets backed by any other digital assets**. Borrowers can receive a loan of ERC-20 tokens backed by their own ERC-20 tokens or NFTs, and lenders can earn interest on their tokens by granting these loans. This process is managed by smart contracts that are completely **trustless, decentralized and immutable**.
