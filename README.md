# What is PWN?

**PWN is a peer-to-peer lending protocol designed for long-term mortgage-like loans of digital assets, backed by other digital assets.** Borrowers can receive a fixed-duration loan of fungible tokens backed by fungible or non-fungible tokens, while lenders can earn interest by granting these loans. The protocol is **trustless, immutable and operates without the need for oracles or protocol-managed liquidations**.

The PWN Protocol is currently deployed on **Ethereum, Polygon and Cronos**.
