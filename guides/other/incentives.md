# Incentives

**What Incentives Are Offered?**

While PWN doesn’t have its own token, the platform will distribute _reputation points_, rewarding active usage and contributions to the PWN ecosystem.

Additionally, third-party incentives (points or tokens) will be distributed by selected projects integrated with PWN. Please note that PWN does not control or hold custody over these rewards, and they will be claimable according to the partner project's claiming processes.

Similar to other lending platforms, both lenders and borrowers will receive rewards.

#### Incentives for Borrowers

Borrowers will earn incentives based on the value of the collateral locked in the escrow contract. Incentives will begin to accrue once the borrower’s proposal is accepted by a lender, or when the borrower accepts an active lending proposal.

Simply posting a borrowing proposal does _not_ qualify borrowers for incentives.

In case of default (failure to repay the loan and interest), the collateral, along with any accrued rewards, will be transferred to the lender. Be sure to repay your loans on time to retain your rewards!

#### Incentives for Lenders

Lenders will receive incentives based on the amount of capital lent (credit). These incentives will start accruing once a lender accepts a borrowing proposal, or when a borrower accepts the lender’s proposal.

Just posting a lending proposal does _not_ qualify lenders for incentives.

As with borrowers, if a borrower defaults, the lender will receive the collateral and all accrued rewards from the borrower.

#### Example Scenario

Project A decides to offer incentives for loans using their token ($ABC) as collateral. Both lenders and borrowers will be rewarded.

* Mark wants to use $1,000 worth of $ABC as collateral to borrow 500 USDC.
* James agrees to lend 500 USDC to Mark and accepts his proposal.
* Rewards will accrue as follows:
  * Mark will be incentivized based on the $1,000 in $ABC he deposited as collateral.
  * James will be incentivized based on the 500 USDC he lent.

If Mark fails to repay the loan, James will claim the $ABC collateral and any rewards that Mark has accrued.
