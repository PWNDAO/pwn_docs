# Reputation Rewards

It's sometimes hard to know who you're dealing with when you're interacting on chain. And reputation becomes a determining factor when it comes to lending. There's a reason why credit scores exist: they inform the creditor about the probability of an actor repaying their debt.\
\
This is with this goal of leveraging reputation markers linked to concrete action that PWN has released its reputation rewards.\
\
Each interaction with the protocol will earn you a certain number of Rep. The more rep you own, the more trustworthy you become for fellow PWN users.\
