# Notifications on PWN

We send notifications about your loans and proposals to keep you in the loop. On this page, you'll find the notification channels we support, how to set them up, and settings you can adjust.&#x20;

We support different channels for receiving your notifications:

* [PUSH](https://app.push.org/) - Decentralised Notification solution we integrate.
* [Discord](https://discord.gg/aWghBQSdHv) - We have a discord bot on our server that sends you notifications into your DMs.
* [Platform](https://app.pwn.xyz/) - Of course you can also see all your notifications on the PWN Platform

{% hint style="info" %}
You'll always find all things notifications in your Notification Center.

### PUSH

You can subscribe to our PUSH notification channel on our Platform from your Notification Center. You'll have to sign a message with your wallet to subscribe.&#x20;

Alternatively you can find our channel and opt-in in the PUSH app with name `PWN Notifications`.&#x20;

### Discord

Our bot will send you DMs with your notifications and for that we need to link your Discord account with your wallet. You can do that by pasting your Discord User ID into our Discord setup modal in your Notification Center. You'll find your Discord User ID when you open your Discord Profile in the bottom left corner of the discord app and find `Copy User ID`.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Make sure to enable DMs from other members of PWN Discord server so our bot can send you notifications. Right click our Discord server in the Discord app and then go into the Privacy Settings.&#x20;

### Notification Settings

You'll find your Notification Settings in your Notification Center.&#x20;

#### Loan Default Warning

By default, you'll receive notifications one and seven days before your loan is due, reminding you to repay. You can customize the number of days in advance to receive these notifications.

#### Follow an Address

You'll receive notifications about the activity of an other address. This is useful if you have more wallets you use on PWN but want to receive notifications on one address.
