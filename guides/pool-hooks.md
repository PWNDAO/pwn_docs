# Pool Hooks

## How does it work?

You can commit assets to a PWN strategy while they earn a base yield in a pool-based protocol like Aave or Morpho. Your assets get pulled out of the pool only when they are to be utilised - earning you a higher yield overall.

Pool Hooks are not always available, and to lend through them, they must be enabled by the specific curator/creator of the respective strategy.

## What protocols are currently supported?

* [Aave](https://app.aave.com/)
* [Morpho](https://app.morpho.org/)

You can see all your available assets from pools in your Dashboard in the **Third-party positions** section.
