# Token bundler

Token bundler is a tool intended to make borrowing on PWN easier. Instead of taking multiple loans against more assets you can bundle them together and create just one loan! This guide is not technical documentation, but don't worry, we have that too! For technical reference, please see our [developer documentation](https://dev-docs.pwn.xyz/smart-contracts/token-bundler).
