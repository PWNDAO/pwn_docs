# Token bundler

Token Bundler is a tool intended to make borrowing on PWN even easier. Instead of taking multiple loans against more assets, you can bundle assets together and simply create one loan!

This tutorial will get you through the bundling of different assets into a single bundle that you can then use as collateral. We’ll also provide instructions on unpacking these bundles. For technical reference regarding Token Bundler, please see PWN’s [developer documentation](https://app.gitbook.com/o/qU5BYc7llstaew78WOHt/s/vO9gnlV7gm6NLYDU5X6P/).&#x20;

### Bundling during the loan request process&#x20;

You can select more than one asset as collateral during the loan request process. In case you're unsure about any part of the loan request process, check out a video tutorial we made just for that.

After you've selected all the assets you want to use as collateral, you will need to approve them in order for the smart contract to interact with them. Once you’ve approved each of the selected assets, you can proceed to create the bundle by selecting the Bundle Collateral button.

Please ensure that you're bundling the right assets! Once you're sure that you’re ready to continue, select the Bundle button to make an on-chain transaction bundling the assets. You can continue with your off-chain loan request creation when the blockchain confirms the transaction.&#x20;

### Token Bundler used as an independent tool&#x20;

If you want to create a bundle, head to the tool selection and select Bundler. There, you'll be able to bundle assets together and unpack existing bundles. Since we want to bundle assets and create a new bundle, select Bundle Assets.

Here, you can select all the assets you want to bundle. Please make sure you've selected the right assets. After that, select Continue.

Double-check your selected assets and, when you’re ready, make the necessary approvals of the assets to the Token Bundler contract. After you approve each of the assets, you can create the bundle by making one final transaction.

And now, you're finished!

### Unbundling

To unpack a bundle that you’ve created or received, select Bundler in the tools section and select Unpack Bundle.

Choose the bundle that you want to unpack and select Continue. Please double-check that you've selected the correct one.

Unpacking the bundle is as easy as selecting the Unpack button and making one transaction in your wallet needed to unpack the bundle. The bundle will be unpacked as soon as the transaction gets confirmed on the blockchain.&#x20;
