# PWN Bundler

The PWN Bundler is a tool that allows you to combine various types of assets, such as ERC-20 tokens and NFTs, into a single bundle that can be used as collateral for loans on PWN.&#x20;

**Create a bundle.**

1. Go to the [borrow](https://app.pwn.xyz/#/create-loan) tab on the right-hand side.
2. Tick the "select multiple assets" box in the "Select Your Collateral" modal.
3. Pick the assets you want to bundle.
4. Click "bundle and continue".
5. Approve every asset (one transaction per asset/NFT collection).
6. Click on "bundle collateral" and approve the transaction.

You'll receive a NFT representing your bundled assets. You can use it as collateral on PWN or transfer it to another wallet to save on gas fees.

**⚠️ You can also create a bundle straight from the** [**bundler page**](https://app.pwn.xyz/#/token-bundler/bundle-assets/choose-assets)**.**



**Unpack a bundle.**

1. Go to the [bundler page](https://app.pwn.xyz/#/token-bundler).
2. Select "Unpack Bundle".
3. Choose the bundle you want to unpack and click the Unpack button.
4. Approve the transaction.
