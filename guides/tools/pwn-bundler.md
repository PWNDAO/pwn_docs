# PWN Bundler

The PWN bundler lets you use multiple assets as collateral. The PWN bundler allows you to mix ERC-20 and NFTs.

**Create a bundle.**

1. Go to the [borrow](https://app.pwn.xyz/#/create-loan) section.
2. Tick the "select multiple assets" box.
3. Pick the assets you want to bundle.
4. Click "bundle and continue".
5. Approve every asset (one transaction per asset/NFT collection).
6. Click on "bundle collateral" and approve the transaction.

You'll receive a NFT representing your bundled assets. You can use it as collateral on PWN or transfer it.

**⚠️ You can also create a bundle straight from the** [**bundler page**](https://app.pwn.xyz/#/token-bundler/bundle-assets/choose-assets)**.**



**Unpack a bundle.**

1. Go to the [bundler page](https://app.pwn.xyz/#/token-bundler).
2. Select "Unpack Bundle".
3. Choose the bundle you want to unpack and click the Unpack button.
4. Approve the transaction.
