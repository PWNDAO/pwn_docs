# Claiming defaulted collateral

### When a borrower repays their loan, the lent asset and interest will be sent directly to your wallet. In the event of a default, their collateral becomes available for claiming.

1. Go to the "Lending" section of the [dashboard](https://app.pwn.xyz/#/dashboard/) or click on the notification icon
2. Find the defaulted loan
3. Click on "Claim Collateral"

Alternatively you can go to the loan page and click on "Claim"

**⚠️ If the defaulted collateral is a bundle of assets, you'll need to unpack it after claiming using the** [**unpacker**](https://app.pwn.xyz/#/token-bundler/unpack-bundle/choose-bundle)**.**  &#x20;
