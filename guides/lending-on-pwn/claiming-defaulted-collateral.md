# Claiming defaulted collateral

### When a borrower repays their loan, the lent asset and interest will be sent directly to your wallet. In the event of a default, their collateral automatically becomes available for claiming.

1. Go to the "Your Lending" section of the [dashboard](https://app.pwn.xyz/#/dashboard/) or click on the notification icon
2. Find the defaulted loan
3. Click on "Claim Collateral"

Alternatively you can go to the loan page and click on "Claim"

**⚠️ As long as the collateral isn't claimed from the escrow contract, your debtor has the possibility to repay their loan. Don't claim too soon (unless it's favorable to you) and try to negotiate a**[ **loan extension**](offering-a-loan-extension.md)**.**&#x20;

**⚠️ If the defaulted collateral is a bundle of assets, you'll need to unpack it after claiming using the** [**unpacker**](https://app.pwn.xyz/#/token-bundler/unpack-bundle/choose-bundle)**.**  &#x20;
