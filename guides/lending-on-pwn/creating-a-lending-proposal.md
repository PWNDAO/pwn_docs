# Creating a lending proposal

### You don't have to wait for a borrowing proposal to be posted; you can proactively post loan offers on the collateral of your choice, and as always with PWN, on your very own terms.

1. Visit [https://app.pwn.xyz](https://app.pwn.xyz/#/create-loan) and connect your wallet.&#x20;
2. Click on "Lend" on the left-hand side module.
3. Select "Atomic Proposal"
4. Pick a collateral and amount (tokens or NFTs).

Once your lending proposal is submitted, it will appear in the "I want to borrow" section of the app, where any borrower will be free to accept it or counter-propose.

**⚠️ The lent asset won't leave your wallet until your lending proposal  gets accepted or you accept a borrowing proposal. Make sure it remains available until your proposal expires or it will be invalid.**

You'll be notified in the app once when one of your proposal  is accepted or if you receive a counteroffer.&#x20;

**⚠️ You can cancel or edit your lending proposal at any time. Simply head to the "Your Lending" section in your dashboard, find the offer you'd like to edit and cancel and click the corresponding button.**\

**⚠️ Please note that PWN only relies on time-based liquidations. Before posting a lending proposal, make sure your give yourself enough buffer to account for potential asset volatility.**
