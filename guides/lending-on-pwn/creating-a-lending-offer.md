# Creating a lending offer

### You don't have to wait for a borrowing proposal to be posted; you can proactively post loan offers on the collateral of your choice, and as always with PWN, on your very own terms.

1. Visit [https://app.pwn.xyz](https://app.pwn.xyz/#/create-loan) and connect your wallet.&#x20;
2. Click on "Lend" on the left-hand side module.
3. Pick a collateral and amount (tokens or NFTs).

4. Pick your credit asset and amount.&#x20;

**NB: Note: Proposals are elastic by default, meaning your proposal can be accepted multiple times until the total allocated credit is fully utilized. Check** [**this section** ](advanced-lending-features.md)**for more information.**

* _Loan duration_
* _Proposal validity period_

6. Submit your lending proposal by clicking on "Post Proposal"

Once your lending proposal is submitted, it will appear in the "I want to borrow" section of the app, where any borrower will be free to accept it or counter-propose.

**⚠️ The lent asset won't leave your wallet until your lending proposal  gets accepted or you accept a borrowing proposal. Make sure it remains available until your proposal expires or it will be invalid.**

You'll be notified in the app once when one of your proposal  is accepted or if you receive a counteroffer.&#x20;

**⚠️ Please note that PWN only relies on time-based liquidations. Before posting a lending proposal, make sure your give yourself enough buffer to account for potential asset volatility.**\

You can cancel or edit your lending proposal at any time. Simply head to the "Your Lending" section in your dashboard, find the offer you'd like to edit and cancel and click the corresponding button.
