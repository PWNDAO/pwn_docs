# Funding loans

### Funding a loan on PWN is easy, predictable, and safe. As a lender, you're free to accept a borrower's terms or counter with your own. &#x20;

**Browse pending borrowing proposals:**

1. Visit [https://app.pwn.xyz](https://app.pwn.xyz/#/create-loan) and connect your wallet.&#x20;

3. If your wallet is connected, the borrowing proposals you can fund will have an active "Lend" button. All the others will be greyed.
