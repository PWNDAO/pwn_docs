There are several way to find loans to fund on PWN:&#x20;

**Browse pending borrowing proposals:**

1. Visit [https://app.pwn.xyz](https://app.pwn.xyz/#/create-loan) and connect your wallet.&#x20;
2. Click on the "I want to lend" tab the left-hand side module.

**Use the top module on the proposal page (**_**I want to lend against all assets**_**):**

1. &#x20;_"All assets" will show all proposals for all assets in the the "I want to lend" tab_
2. _"Select assets" lets you search for any asset. All relevant proposals will be pushed in the "I want to lend" tab_
3. _"Stable/ETH" will only show borrowing proposals requesting ETH and stablecoins._
4. If a proposal fits your terms, click on the "Lend" button.



**⚠️ The asset to be lent will stay in your wallet while the proposal is active. If you move or swap it, the proposal will become invalid.**
