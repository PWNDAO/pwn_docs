# Creating a borrowing offer

### Since PWN is peer-to-peer, every borrower must create a borrowing offer on the platform, detailing the collateral they want to use (tokens, NFTs, or a bundle of both), the asset to borrow, and the loan terms they are comfortable with.

1. Visit [https://app.pwn.xyz/offers/borrow](https://app.pwn.xyz/offers/borrow) and connect your wallet.&#x20;
2. Click "Make a Custom Offer" button
3. Pick your collateral and amount (you can use tokens and NFTs, and even [bundle](../tools/pwn-bundler.md) both).

_After you select your collateral and/or borrowed asset, the app will **automatically push all matching lending offers** in the "Borrow" module on the left. If one fits your terms, just click on the "Borrow" button._
{% endhint %}

4. Pick the borrowed asset and amount

5. Pick your desired loan terms:

* _Loan to Value_
* _Fixed APR (Interest rate)_
* _Max Loan Duration_
* _Proposal validity period_
* _Advanced Settings: adjust the Minimum Borrow Amount_&#x20;

6. Review and submit your borrowing offer by clicking on "Post Offer"

Once your borrowing offer is submitted, it will appear in the "Lend" section of the Market, where any lender will be free to fund it or counter-offer.

**⚠️ The asset(s) listed as collateral won't leave your wallet until your borrowing offer gets funded. Make sure they remain available until your offer expires or it will be invalid.**

You'll be notified in the app once when one of your offer gets funded.&#x20;

Once you get funded, you'll be prompted to [set a reminder](https://app.pwn.xyz/#/notification-center). **All you have to do next is to make sure you repay on time to avoid defaulting.**

**⚠️ You can cancel or edit your borrowing offer at any time. Simply head to the "Your Lending" section in your Dashboard, find the offer you'd like to edit and cancel and click the corresponding button.**
