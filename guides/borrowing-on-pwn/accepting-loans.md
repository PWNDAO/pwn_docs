# Accepting loans

### Getting funded viaa PWN is easy. As a borrower, you can browse existing lending proposals,  accept the ones you like or counter on your own terms. &#x20;

1. Visit [https://app.pwn.xyz](https://app.pwn.xyz/#/create-loan) and connect your wallet.&#x20;
2. Click on the "borrow" tab the left-hand side module.

Lending proposals with an active 'Borrow' button are available for you to accept. All others will appear greyed out.&#x20;

Unless otherwise specified, you don’t need to borrow the full amount offered—you can request only a portion of the credit.

4. If you agree with the terms offered, click on the "Borrow" button. That's it!&#x20;

Once you get funded, you'll be prompted to [set a reminder](https://app.pwn.xyz/#/notification-center). **All you have to do next is to make sure you repay on time to avoid defaulting.**
