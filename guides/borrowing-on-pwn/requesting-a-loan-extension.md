# Requesting a loan extension

### A borrower can request a loan extension at any time during the loan or even after default. This extension will prolong the initial loan terms for a specified period.

1. Go to the "Your Borrowing" section of the [dashboard](https://app.pwn.xyz/#/dashboard/)
2. Pick the loan you want to extend&#x20;
3. Click on "Request Loan Extension"
4. State your terms
   1. Loan extension duration
   2. Payment token: that's what you're willing to give your lender for the favor
   3. Proposal expiration
   4. Message to your lender (optional)
5. Click on "Send loan extension request"

**⚠️ Your lender is free to accept or ignore the loan extension proposal. You'll be notified either way and will have the possibility to send a more enticing loan extension request.**

**⚠️ You can cancel a loan extension request at any time. Simply click on your active loan and on the "Cancel extension request" button.**

Once you're request is accepted, you loan maturity will be automatically adjusted. Make sure to update your notifications.

A lender can also proactively send you a loan extension offer. In that case, you'll receive a notification, and the offer will be accessible from the 'Your Borrowing' tab in the dashboard as well as from the proposal page.
