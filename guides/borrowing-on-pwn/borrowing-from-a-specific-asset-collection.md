# Borrowing from a specific asset/collection

### Lenders on PWN can make outstanding lending proposals for the collateral of their choice. As a borrower, you have several ways to find them.



* [Start a borrowing proposal](creating-a-borrowing-proposal.md) by selecting your collateral and borrowed asset. The app will automatically push relevant lending proposals in the "I want to borrow" tab.

* Use the Explorer section to look up assets. This method is a bit less effective as you won't benefit from the app's automatic proposal matching.&#x20;

If a lending proposal matches your preferences, simply click on the "Borrow" button.
