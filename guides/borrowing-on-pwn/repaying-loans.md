# Repaying loans

PWN is oracle-less, which means the only way to lose your collateral is by missing the repayment deadline (don't forget to [set a reminder](https://app.pwn.xyz/#/notification-center)!)

To repay your loan:

1. Go to the "borrow" tab on your [dashboard](https://app.pwn.xyz/#/dashboard/) and find the active loan you want to repay
2. Click the "repay" button
3. Approve tokens
4. Repay

You are free to repay anytime before the final repayment deadline, but keep in mind that regardless of what date you choose, **full interest will be due**.&#x20;
