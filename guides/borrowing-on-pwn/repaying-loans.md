# Repaying loans

### PWN is **oracle-less** and relies on a **time-based liquidation mechanism**, which means the only way to lose your collateral is by missing the repayment deadline. Don't forget to set a reminder!

To repay your loan:

1. Go to the "Your Borrowing" tab on your [dashboard](https://app.pwn.xyz/#/dashboard/) and find the active loan you want to repay
2. Click the "repay" button
3. Your collateral will be automatically returned to your wallet.

Alternatively, you can also repay from the loan page:

**⚠️ You are free to repay at any time before the final repayment deadline, and you'll only pay the pro-rata interest due.**
