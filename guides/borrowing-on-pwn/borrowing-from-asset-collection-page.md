# Borrowing from asset/collection page

Lenders on PWN can make outstanding loan offers for the collateral of their choice. As a borrower, you can find potential loan offers by looking up the asset you'd like to use as collateral:

1. Go to your [dashboard](https://app.pwn.xyz/#/dashboard/) and pick one of the assets you hold; you can also use the platform-wide search bar
2. Browse loan offers in the dedicated section or on the offers tab (for NFTs)
3. [If an offer fits your terms, click accept](#user-content-fn-1)[^1]
