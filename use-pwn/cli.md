# CLI

**You can use the PWN protocol without a front-end** like the [PWN platform](https://app.pwn.xyz/)**.** Please refer to our [**Developer documentation**](https://dev-docs.pwn.xyz/) **** to learn everything you need to know before interacting with the PWN protocol.

**We recommend Cast** as the go-to CLI tool. Read more information about Cast in the [Foundry documentation](https://book.getfoundry.sh/cast/index.html).
